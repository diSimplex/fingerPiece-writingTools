To install LaTeX and ConTeXt, we use the excellent
#link("https://tug.org/texlive/")[texlive distribution]. You can either install
the 'full' distribution `scheme`, or one or more of its various 'collections'
(see the
#link("https://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-240003.2.2")[Selecting
what is to be installed] section of the
#link("https://tug.org/texlive/doc.html")[texlive documentation]). 

At a bare minium you will need to ensure `lualatex` and `context` are
installed. (This #emph[should] also ensure `metapost` is installed as well).

We use our own #link("https://github.com/litProgLaTeX")['Literate Programming in
LaTeX' tools], `lpilMagicRunner`, `cfdoit` as well as the
#link("https://github.com/litProgLaTeX/lpil-latex")[lpil-latex] style.
